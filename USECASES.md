The Cromwell group has 4 instances via 2 projects where TES is being considered. These are all similar enough to effectively be a single use case. The idea is to present an institution's local compute as a private cloud via a standardized interface in a similar manner to Google's Pipelines API. These would all fit PAPI's "docker as a service" model. In all cases some combination of polling or pubsub to detect job completion is necessary. For all of these use cases the intention is to handle situations where the data must stay local so merely describing where the local input/outputs should be is sufficient, but something more complex can be made to work. We will need to extract stdout/stderr and system logs. We will need authN/authZ as specified by the host site for all of these.
